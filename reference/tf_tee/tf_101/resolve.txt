 resolve command:

  Lets you resolve conflicts between changed items in your workspace and the latest or destination versions of items on the server.
  
  When -auto:External is specified, file contents are merged using the program specified by the TF_MERGE_COMMAND environment variable.  TF_MERGE_COMMAND must
  contain the program to launch and the required variables (shown below).  Additional tool-specific options or optional variables may also be specified.
  Arguments may be quoted according to Windows-style shell quoting rules.
  
  The following variables are expanded before the tool is launched:
  
  Required variables:
  
    %1  the full local path of the original (server) file
  
    %2  the full local path of the local (modified) file
  
    %4  the full local path of the merged (resultant) file
  
  Optional variables:
  
    %3  the full local path of the common (baseline) file
  
    %5  diff command-line options (rarely used)
  
    %6  a descriptive label for the original (server) file
  
    %7  a descriptive label for the local (modified) file
  
    %8  a descriptive label for the common (baseline) file
  
    %9  a descriptive label for the merged (resultant) file
