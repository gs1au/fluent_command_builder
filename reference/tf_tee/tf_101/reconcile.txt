Team Explorer Everywhere (version 10.1.0.201101271439)

 reconcile command:

  Displays or undoes pending changes which are identical to items in the changeset created when a gated check-in build completes successfully.  Running the
  command with no arguments displays the gated check-ins submitted from this computer.  Use the buildName or changeset option to specify a build or changeset
  to reconcile.  Use the forgetBuild option to remove a build from the local list of gated check-ins submitted on this computer (server information is not
  modified).
  
  When item specs are supplied as free arguments, only those pending changes will be reconciled with the changeset created by the gated check-in. If no item
  specs are supplied, all pending changes which match items in the changeset will be reconciled.
  
  The buildName, forgetBuild, and teamProject options may contain wildcards.

 Valid option sets:

  reconcile [-teamProject:<value>]
  reconcile -buildName:<value> [-teamProject:<value>] [-recursive] [<itemSpec>...]
  reconcile -changeset:<value> [-recursive] [<itemSpec>...]
  reconcile -forgetBuild:<buildName> [-teamProject:<value>]
