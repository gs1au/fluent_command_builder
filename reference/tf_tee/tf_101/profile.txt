Team Explorer Everywhere (version 10.1.0.201101271439)

 profile command:

  Creates, deletes, edits, and copies named login profiles.  Profiles created on this computer can only be accessed on this computer.  Use the profiles command
  to show existing profiles.
  
  All profiles should contain a Team Foundation Server project collection URL, and may contain other connection information like user credentials and network
  proxy settings.  Listed below are some of the most common profile properties and their types.
  
  'serverUrl' (string): The URL of the Team Foundation Server project collection.  All profiles should define this property.
  
  'userName' (string): The username used to authenticate to the Team Foundation Server.  If this property is not defined, the program can prompt for it when it
  is needed.
  
  'userDomain' (string): The Windows domain used to authenticate to the Team Foundation Server.  If this property is not defined, the program can prompt for it
  when it is needed.
  
  'password' (string): The password used to authenticate to the Team Foundation Server.  If this property is not defined, the program can prompt for it when it
  is needed.
  
  'useDefaultCredentials' (boolean): When true, and default credentials are available, they will be used instead of the credentials stored in this profile to
  authenticate to the Team Foundation Server.  When false or not set, the credentials in this profile will be used instead of any available default credentials.
  
  'httpProxyEnabled' (boolean): When true, an HTTP proxy is used when connecting to a Team Foundation Server.  When false or not set, no HTTP proxy is used.
  
  'httpProxyIgnoreGlobal' (boolean): When true, the proxy server URL configured in the profile is used.  When false or not set, the value of the HTTP_PROXY
  environment variable value is used as the proxy server URL.  When httpProxyEnabled is false, this property has no effect.
  
  'httpProxyUrl' (string): The URL of the HTTP proxy server to use.
  
  'httpProxyEnableAuth' (boolean): When true, the HTTP proxy credentials in this profile are used to authenticate to an HTTP proxy.  When false or not set, no
  authentication to the HTTP proxy is done.
  
  'httpProxyUsername' (string): The username used to authenticate to the configured HTTP proxy.
  
  'httpProxyPassword' (string): The password used to authenticate to the configured HTTP proxy.  
  
  'tfProxyEnabled' (boolean): When true, the Team Foundation proxy URL defined in this profile is used when downloading files from a Team Foundation Server.
  When false or not set, no Team Foundation proxy is used.
  
  'tfProxyIgnoreGlobal' (boolean): When true, the Team Foundation proxy server URL configured in the profile is used to accelerate file transfers.  When false
  or not set, the value of the TFSPROXY environment variable value is used as the proxy server URL.  When tfProxyEnabled is false, this property has no effect.
  
  'tfProxyUrl' (string): The URL of the Team Foundation proxy server to use.
  
  'acceptUntrustedCertificates' (boolean): When true, the program will accept SSL certificates that cannot be verified (trusted) without error.  If false or
  not set, the program will not accept untrusted SSL certificates.
  
  Passwords will be saved in an encrypted format by your operating system, using Keychain.
