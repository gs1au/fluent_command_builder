 difference command:

  Displays differences between two files, files in two folders, or a shelveset and a local or server file.
  
  Differences in file contents are displayed using the program and arguments specified by the value of the
  TF_DIFF_COMMAND environment variable, which must be set.  TF_DIFF_COMMAND must contain the program to launch and
  the required variables (shown below).  Additional tool-specific options or optional variables may also be
  specified.  Arguments may be quoted according to Windows-style shell quoting rules.  
  
  The following variables are expanded before the tool is launched:
  
  Required variables:
  
    %1  the full local path of the source item
  
    %2  the full local path of the target item
  
  Optional variables:
  
    %6  a descriptive label for the source item
  
    %7  a descriptive label for the target item
  
  Examples:
  
    (GNU diff, unified)     diff -u --label "%6 / %7" "%1" "%2"
  
    (SourceGear DiffMerge)  diffmerge --title1="%6" --title2="%7" "%1" "%2"
