Team Explorer Everywhere (version 10.0.0.201003261741)

 branch command:

  Creates a "branch" pending change, which copies one or more items, including history, from one source control
  server location to another. The local workspace is updated immediately with the new copy, unless the 'noget'
  option is supplied.

 Valid option sets:

  branch [-version:<value>] [-noget] [-lock:none|checkin|checkout] [-recursive] [-checkin] <oldItemSpec>
         <newLocalItem>
